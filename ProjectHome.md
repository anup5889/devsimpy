**DEVSimPy** is an advanced wxPython GUI for the modeling and simulation of systems based on the DEVS _(Discrete EVent system Specification)_ formalism. Features include powerful built-in editor, advanced modeling approach, powerful discrete event simulation algorithm, import/export DEVS components library and more.

# What is DEVSimPy #

**DEVSimPy** is an wxPython-based environment for the simulation of complex systems defined by the DEVS formalism. Its development is supported by the [SPE](http://spe.univ-corse.fr) research laboratory team. The main goal of this environment is to facilitate the modeling of DEVS systems using the GUI library and the drag-and-drop approach.

# Requirements #

The use of DEVSimPy requires:

  1. [Python](http://python.org) version 2.4+
  1. [wxPython](http://wxpython.org) version 2.6+ ansi/unicode (unicode recommended)
  1. [Scipy](http://scipy.org) and [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org) (optional, for spectrum analysis)

DEVSimPy should be used like a normal Python file, i.e., double-clicking on the devsimpy.py file which is located in the root directory or writing python devismpy.py_into a python console._

Users which don't want to install python with all dependency can use [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/) (version 2.x). Then, just extract DEVSimPy archive and edit the devsimpy.py file with [PyScripter](https://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/) to execute it.

# Features #

With DEVSimPy we can:

  * model a DEVS system and save or export it into a library,
  * edit the code of DEVS model to modify behavior's also during the simulation,
  * import existing library of models (python code or DEVSimPy specific models) which allows the specific domain modeling (Power system, continuous, etc),
  * automatically simulate the system and perform its analysis during the simulation (with the suspend option)
  * ..
